# Pipeline LLC Code Eval 

## Running locally
There's not much special to do outside of running `bin/setup` to get started.

You will, however, need a master key to access the credentials file, where the pipeline api key is stored. Contact me and I'll send it over to you!

You will also need to get sidekiq running. If you're using foreman, or `heroku local` it'll start up as a predefined process, otherwise you'll need to start it manually.
